## View previous versions of the documentation

The versions of the documentation are tagged by release date in the following format:

```
lisk-docs-yyyy-mm-dd
```

Additionally, each products documentation has it's own release tags, referring to the products versioning scheme.
This makes it convenient to find the corresponding documentation version for a specific version of the product.

Examples:

```
core-1.3.0
elements-2.1.0
commander-2.0.0
```

> If changes are made to the documentation in between two product versions, a new tag will be created for it and a documentation version will be appended to the tag.
> Example: `commander-2.0.0-1.0.1`
