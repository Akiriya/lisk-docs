# Lisk Commander Documentation

Lisk Commander is a Command-Line-Interface Tool designed to facilitate delegates, node operators, contributors to the Lisk codebase, developers using Lisk’s infrastructure (and anyone else who’s interested) to make use of Lisk’s functionality from the command line with ease.

Lisk Commander allows to communicate with a remote or local node and carry out Lisk-related functionality.

This can be for example:

- create a transaction
- decrypt/encrypt passphrases or messages
- create accounts
- get delegates
- ... many more examples can be found on the [commands](user-guide/commands/commands.md) page.
