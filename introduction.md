Lisk Hub is an all-in-one solution to manage your Lisk ID, access and send LSK tokens, as well as vote for delegates. It combines functionality from the former wallet and blockchain explorer. In the future, Lisk Hub will feature a DEX (decentralised exchange), Sidechain's registration and the ability to launch your own ICO.
