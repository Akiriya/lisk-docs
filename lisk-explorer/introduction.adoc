Lisk Explorer is a tool that visualizes the vast information from Lisk's
blockchain .

It can be used for gathering information about particular blocks and
transactions, but also for some general information about the whole
network and its delegates status. Components like Network Monitor and
Delegate Monitor show the status of the whole ecosystem in real time.

[[networks]]
Networks
~~~~~~~~

Similarly to Lisk Core, Lisk Explorer can be connected to different
networks. The network is defined by the node it is connected to (under
`config.lisk.host` attribute in the config file). There are two key
public networks, entirely independent of each other, that are always
accessible: *Mainnet* and *Testnet*.

[[mainnet]]
Mainnet
^^^^^^^

Mainnet is where the true Lisk economy exists. On this network, Lisk
users are able to transfer LSK tokens from one account to another,
register accounts as delegates, vote for another delegates or register
dApps. It can be explored via the https://explorer.lisk.io[Lisk
Explorer].

[[testnet]]
Testnet
^^^^^^^

Testnet is an independent replica of the Lisk Mainnet intended as an
area to rehearse upgrades before they take place on the Lisk Mainet.
This is where new versions and fixes of Lisk Core are tested. It can be
explored via https://testnet-explorer.lisk.io[Lisk Tesnet Explorer].
