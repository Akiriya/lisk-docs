[[pre-install]]
Pre-install
~~~~~~~~~~~

This document will detail how to prepare a system to run Lisk Core as a
Docker-based container. To run Lisk in Docker a user must first install
the Docker Engine. Additionally, it is recommended to install Docker
Compose for convenience.

Determine if your platform can run Docker.

[[supported-platforms]]
Supported Platforms

Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#desktop

[[mac-os-x]]
Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/. Please
note that Docker for Mac already includes Docker Compose. Install `make`
using https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/[XCode]

[[windows]]
Windows
^^^^^^^

Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
Please note that Docker for Windows includes Docker Compose.

[[linux]]
Linux
^^^^^

Please refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#server

To install Docker Compose, please refer to
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

*Important*: Configure Docker, so it can be run without `sudo` rights:
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/

Install `make` using your package manager. For example, use `apt-get` if
running Ubuntu:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install make
----

[[open-necessary-ports]]
Open necessary ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To connect to the desired network with Lisk Core, please ensure that the
corresponding ports are open:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|====================================
|Network |httpPort(HTTP) |wsPort(TCP)
|Mainnet |8000 |8001
|Testnet |7000 |7001
|Betanet |5000 |5001
|Devnet |4000 |5000
|====================================

These are the default ports for connecting with the network, these can
be altered later in `.env`.

[[create-a-new-user]]
Create a new user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run and manage a Lisk Core node in the future, please create a
separate 'lisk' user like so:

[[ubuntu]]
Ubuntu
++++++

The `lisk` user itself *does not need* any `sudo` rights to run Lisk
Core. It is sufficient to create a group `docker` and add the newly
created user to that group, to enable the user to use Docker (see:
https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser lisk              # create a new user
sudo groupadd docker           # create docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker lisk   # add the user to docker group
----

[[installation]]
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[get-configuration-and-makefile]]
Get configuration and Makefile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk[Lisk Repository].

[source,bash]
----
su - lisk                                    # switch to lisk user
git clone git@github.com:LiskHQ/lisk-sdk.git # clone the repository
cd lisk/docker                               # navigate into docker directory
----

It contains a directory `docker` with the following files: -
`.env.development` - `.env.mainnet` - `.env.testnet` -
`docker-compose.make.yml`: used by `make coldstart`. -
`docker-compose.override.yml`: use this file to overwrite `LISK_`
variables (empty by default). - `docker-compose.redis.yml`: enable cache
(optional). - `docker-compose.yml` - `Makefile`

The `.env`-files are templates with network specific environment
variables.

[[set-environment-variables]]
Set environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To connect to the Lisk network, the environment variables need to be set
accordingly.

Before setting the variables, you may want to edit them in the
respective `.env.{network}` file.

It is recommended to change the password for the database, which is
stored in `ENV_LISK_DB_PASSWORD`.

To install a specific version of Lisk Core, set the `ENV_LISK_VERSION`
to the respective version.

After adjusting them, copy the environment variables to a file called
`.env`:

[source,bash]
----
cp .env.{network} .env
----

Where `{network}` stands for the Lisk network you want to connect to.

[[coldstart-application]]
Coldstart application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[option-1-makefile]]
Option 1: Makefile
++++++++++++++++++

We recommend to use the Makefile:

[source,bash]
----
make  # will run `docker-compose up` for you
----

Makefile provides a convenient way to
link:../administration/docker.md#sync-from-snapshot[sync your node from
snapshot]:

[source,bash]
----
make coldstart  # will download and restore a blockchain snapshot for you
----

[[option-2-docker-compose]]
Option 2: docker-compose
++++++++++++++++++++++++

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d # initialize Lisk Core
docker-compose ps    # see the status of Lisk Core
docker-compose logs  # see logs
----

As next step, check out link:../administration/docker.md[Docker
Administration] to learn how to manage your Node.
