## User Guide

### Using environment variables

By using environment variables, the user can
- automatically login to the application on startup, with a pre defined account during development
- connect to a custom node

In order to do so, the file `env.json` inside the lisk-mobile installation folder needs to serve the needed variables.

```js
{
 "network": "customNode",
 "address": "https://testnet.lisk.io",
 "passphrase": "drastic spot aerobic web wave tourist library first scout fatal inherit arrange",
 "secondPassphrase": "second custom passphrase"
}
```

- `network` 
  - `customNode` indicates, another variable `address` is set, which will be used when Lisk Mobile is started.
  - `testnet` will try to connect to a predefined testnet node, it is not needed to set `address`. If `address` is set, it will overwrite the predefined node.
- `address` takes an URL to a Lisk node, Lisk Mobile shall connect to.
- `passphrase` a mnemonic passphrase cann be specified here, that will be prefilled on the Login screen of Lisk Mobile.
- `secondPassphrase` lets the user predefine the second passphrase for the account as well, if it is needed.

npm start
