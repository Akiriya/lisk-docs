# Lisk Hub Configuration

In the settings you currently have the option to customize your app in terms of `security`,  `Advanced features`and `local`. Here you can also start a tour through the Hub with our onboarding. More options will be added in future.

## Security

Here you can register for a `second passphrase` for a fee 5 LSK  and turn off the `auto-lock`, which would usually log you out of your account after 10 minutes.

## Advanced features

If you would like to connect to `Testnet` or a `Custom Node`, you can turn on the network options here, which will then be visible on the login page.  Furthermore, you can turn on the `Delegate features`, to vote and receive more information about delegates.

## Local

Here you can select your preferred currency conversion.
