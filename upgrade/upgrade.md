# Lisk Commander Upgrade

If you already have Lisk Commander installed and wish to upgrade your installation, you can follow one of the links in the table below for your specific distribution.

## Upgrade Lisk Commander via NPM

To update your global installation to the latest version of Lisk Commander, simply run the following command:

```shell
npm update --global lisk-commander
```

## Upgrade Lisk Commander from source

Pull the latest tagged release using Git from your Lisk Commander Directory

```shell
git pull master
npm install
```

If you installed Lisk Commander globally (using `npm install` rather than `npm link`), don't forget to reinstall it globally again if that's what you need. Instructions can be found here.
