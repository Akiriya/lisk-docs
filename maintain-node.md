# Maintain a Node

## What is a Lisk node?

The Lisk blockchain is a decentralized network, that consists of many different servers/nodes around the world, which are controlled by individuals.
These nodes communicate with the network, e.g. by broadcasting and receiving blocks or transactions from their peers.
A Lisk node is also required to forge/add new blocks to the blockchain.

By setting up an own Lisk node, you have full control to configure it to your specific needs, for example:

- Store and explore the Lisk blockchain data on your own server.
- Define the [Network](../lisk-core/introduction.md#networks) you want your node to connect to.
- [Configure](../lisk-core/configuration.md#api-access-control) the [API endpoints](../lisk-core) to be private or public available.
- [Forge](../lisk-core/user-guide/configuration#forging) / add new blocks to the blockchain.
