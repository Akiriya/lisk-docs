=== Pre-Install

This document details the prerequisites to install Lisk Core from a
Source installation using tagged releases on Github. To complete the
installation, some prerequisites need to be fulfilled. If you have
already performed these, please proceed to the
link:#installation[Installation] chapter.

Firstly, please determine if your platform can install Lisk Core from
source.

==== Supported Platforms

* Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS) x86_64
* Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) x86_64
* MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
* MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)

==== Open necessary ports

To connect to the desired network with Lisk Core, please ensure that the
corresponding ports are open:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Network |httpPort(HTTP) |wsPort(TCP)
|Mainnet |8000 |8001
|Testnet |7000 |7001
|Betanet |5000 |5001
|Devnet |4000 |5000
|===

These are the default ports for connecting with the network, they can be
altered later in `+config.json+`.

==== Create a new user

To install the required prerequisites, it is necessary to have a user
with sudo rights on the server. To run and manage a Lisk Core node in
the future, please create a separate `Lisk' user like so:

===== Ubuntu

____
The `+lisk+` user itself *does not need* any `+sudo+` rights to run Lisk
Core.
____

[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser lisk
----

==== Toolchain components

Used for compiling dependencies.

===== Ubuntu

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential python-minimal
----

===== MacOS

Ensure that both https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[XCode] and
https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] are installed.

==== Git

https://github.com/git/git[Git] is used for cloning and updating Lisk.

===== Ubuntu

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y git
----

===== MacOS

[source,bash]
----
brew install git
----

==== Node.js

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] serves as the underlying engine for code
execution.

===== Node version manager

We recommend using a Node version manager such as
https://github.com/creationix/nvm[NVM]. NVM is a bash script that
enables you to manage multiple active Node.js versions.

[arabic]
. Login as `+lisk+` user, that has been created in the first step:

[source,bash]
----
sudo -u lisk -i
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Install nvm following these
https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation[instructions]
. Install the correct version of Node.js using nvm:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install 10.15.3
----

For the following steps, log out from the `+lisk+` user again with
`+CTRL+D+`, and continue with your user with sudo rights.

===== Node.js Package

Alternatively, you can install Node.js system-wide via a package
manager, like so:

===== Ubuntu

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
----

===== MacOS

[source,bash]
----
brew install node@10.15.3
----

==== PostgreSQL

To install Postgres follow the intructions descibed below, depending on
the operating system your machine is running on. If you run into issues
when trying to set up PostgreSQL on your machine, try to install it
inside of a docker container.

____
We recommend using Postgres with Docker for a quick and straight forward
setup of Postgres.
____

===== A. Postgres with Docker

Running Postgres inside a Docker container will setup the correct
version of Postgres and containerize it away from any existing versions
you may have locally on your machine. Chose this setup if you are not
familiar with Postgres, or if you run in to issues with a previously
installed version of Postgres. To perform the command below
successfully, install Docker like described in the Setup page of
link:docker.md[Lisk Core Docker distribution].

____
If you have other versions of PostgreSQL installed on your machine, make
sure to stop them before starting the docker container.
____

[source,bash]
----
docker run --name lisk_core_db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=lisk -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=lisk_<NETWORK> -d postgres:10
----

This will install PostgreSQL version 10 (`+postgres:10+`) in a container
with name `+lisk_core_db+` and binds the port `+5432+` of the container
with the same port of the machine. As environment variables we expose
`+POSTGRES_USER=lisk+` to create the lisk user and
`+POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password+` to set the password for the lisk user.
Finally the environment variable `+POSTGRES_DB+` creates the database
`+lisk_<NETWORK>+` with the `+lisk+` user as owner.

The above should be enough to set up the database ready to use with Lisk
Core. To manage the Docker container, use the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker stop lisk_core_db # stop the container
docker start lisk_core_db # start the container
docker restart lisk_core_db # restart the container
docker rm lisk_core_db # remove the container
----

In case you want to access Postgres inside the container via CLI, run:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec --tty --interactive lisk_core_db psql -h localhost -U lisk -d postgres
----

===== B. Postgres system-wide

====== Ubuntu

Firstly, install postgreSQL on your machine:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get purge -y postgres* # remove all already installed postgres versions
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
sudo apt install wget ca-certificates
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-10
----

After installation, you should see the Postgres database cluster, by
running

[source,bash]
----
pg_lsclusters
----

Drop the existing database cluster, and replace it with a cluster with
the locale `+en_US.UTF-8+`:

[source,bash]
----
sudo pg_dropcluster --stop 10 main
sudo pg_createcluster --locale en_US.UTF-8 --start 10 main
----

Create a new database user called `+lisk+` and grant it rights to create
databases. Then create the database with the lisk user as owner. In the
last step, define the password for the lisk user:

[source,bash]
----
sudo -u postgres -i createuser --createdb lisk
sudo -u postgres -i createdb lisk_<NETWORK> --owner lisk
sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_<NETWORK> -c "alter user lisk with password 'password';"
----

`+<NETWORK>+` may be `+main+` for Mainnet, `+test+` for Testnet or
`+dev+` for Devnet.

____
Change `password' to a secure password of your choice. Don’t forget to
update this password in the link:configuration.md[Lisk SDK
configuration] later on.
____

====== MacOS

Install Postgres version 10:

[source,bash]
----
brew install postgresql@10
----

Add it to the systems path:

[source,bash]
----
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@10/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/postgresql@10/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/postgresql@10/include"
----

Start Postgres, create the `+lisk+` user and the database:

[source,bash]
----
initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8 --locale=en_US.UTF-8
brew services start postgresql@10
createuser --createdb lisk
createdb lisk_<NETWORK> --owner lisk
psql -d lisk_<NETWORK> -c "alter user lisk with password 'password';"
----

`+<NETWORK>+` may be `+main+` for Mainnet, `+test+` for Testnet or
`+dev+` for Devnet.

____
Change `+'password'+` to a secure password of your choice. Don’t forget
to update this password in the link:../configuration.md[Lisk Core
configuration] later on.
____

==== PM2 (optional)

Install https://github.com/Unitech/pm2[PM2] for managing start/stop of
the app process in the background:

[source,bash]
----
npm install pm2 -g
----

==== Redis (optional)

===== Ubuntu

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install redis-server
----

Start Redis:

[source,bash]
----
sudo service redis-server start
----

Stop Redis:

[source,bash]
----
sudo service redis-server stop
----

===== MacOS

[source,bash]
----
brew install redis
----

Start Redis:

[source,bash]
----
brew services start redis
----

Stop Redis:

[source,bash]
----
brew services stop redis
----

____
Lisk does not run on the redis default port of `+6379+`. Instead it is
configured to run on port: `+6380+`. Due to this, to run Lisk, you have
one of two options:
____

A. *Change the Lisk configuration*

In the next installation phase, remember to update the Redis port
configuration in `+config.json+`.

B. *Change the Redis launch configuration*

Update the launch configuration file on your system. Note that there are
many ways to do this.

The following is one example:

[arabic]
. Stop redis-server
. Edit the file `+redis.conf+` and change: `+port 6379+` to
`+port 6380+`
* Ubuntu/Debian: `+/etc/redis/redis.conf+`
* MacOS: `+/usr/local/etc/redis.conf+`
. Start redis-server

Now confirm that redis is running on `+port 6380+`:

[source,bash]
----
redis-cli -p 6380
ping
----

And you should get the result `+PONG+`.

If you have finished all the above steps successfully, your system is
ready for installation of Lisk Core.

=== Installation

This section details how to install Lisk Core from Source. When
completed, you will have a functioning node on the Lisk Network. If you
are looking to upgrade your current Lisk Core installation, please see
link:../upgrade/source.md[Upgrade from Source].

==== Login as the Lisk user

This user was created in the link:#pre-install[Prerequisites]. If you
are already logged in to this user, please skip this step.

[source,bash]
----
sudo -u lisk -i
----

==== Installing Lisk from Source

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core.git # clone the repository
cd lisk-core                  # navigate into the lisk-core root folder
git checkout v2.0.0 -b v2.0.0 # check out the latest release tag
npm ci                        # install dependencies
npm run build                 # compile packages
----

____
Please check for latest release on
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core/releases
____

To test that Lisk Core is built and configured correctly, issue the
following command to connect to the network:

[source,bash]
----
node dist/index.js # Default: connect to Devnet
LISK_NETWORK=[network] node dist/index.js # Use environment variables to overwrite config values (recommended)
node dist/index.js --network [network]  # Use flags to overwrite config values
----

Where `+[network]+` might be either `+devnet+` (default), `+alphanet+`,
`+betanet+`, `+testnet+` or `+mainnet+`.

It is recommended to overwrite the config values with environment
variables if needed. Useable variables will always start with `+LISK_+`
prefix. Alternatively, the user may define a custom `+config.json+`,
like described in link:../configuration.md[Configuarion of Lisk Core]
Click here, to see a
link:../administration/source.md#command-line-options[list of available
environment variables]

If the process is running correctly, no errors are thrown in the logs.
By default, errors will be logged in `+logs/[network]/lisk.log+`. Once
the process is verified as running correctly, `+CTRL+C+` and start the
process with `+pm2+`. This will fork the process into the background and
automatically recover the process if it fails.

[source,bash]
----
pm2 start --name lisk dist/index.js -- --network [network]
----

Where `+[network]+` might be either `+devnet+` (default), `+alphanet+`,
`+betanet+`, `+testnet+` or `+mainnet+`.

For details on how to manage or stop your Lisk node, please have a look
in link:../administration/source.md[Administration from Source].

If you are not running Lisk locally, you will need to follow the
link:../configuration.md#api-access-control[Configuration - API]
document to enable access.

That’s it! You are ready to move on to the
link:../configuration.md[configuration] documentation if you wish to
enable forging or SSL.

=== Post-installation (optional)

* Recommended: Set up a link:../configuration.md#logrotation[log
rotation]
