[IMPORTANT]
====
*Important:* Since the secret passphrase is a sensitive input, it can be provided using one of the available methods described in the xref:lisk-commander/user-guide/sensitive-inputs.adoc[Sensitive Inputs section].
The encrypted message can be provided either directly as an argument, or by specifying a source with the `â€“message` option.
If both the secret passphrase and the encrypted message are provided via stdin, the secret passphrase must be given in the first line and the encrypted message must be given in the subsequent lines.
