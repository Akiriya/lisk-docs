==== Create a new user

To run and manage a Lisk Core node in the future, please create a separate `lisk` user like so:

The `lisk` user itself *does not need* any `sudo` rights to run Lisk Core.
It is sufficient to create a group `+docker+` and add the newly created user to that group, to enable the user to use Docker (see: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/).

[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser lisk              <1>
sudo groupadd docker           <2>
sudo usermod -aG docker lisk   <3>
----

<1> create a new user
<2> create docker group
<3> add the user to docker group

It is not essentially needed to set up a `lisk` user, especially when you are runnign a local instance for development pruposes.
If you still want to do it, we recommend to create the user using the macOS GUI: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mtusr001/mac
