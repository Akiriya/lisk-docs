== What is a blockchain application?

Blockchain applications communicate within a network to agree upon which data is valid and therefore should be stored, or whether it should be rejected and bad actors potentially punished.

The set of blockchain rules is already implemented by Lisk modules and libraries.
By reusing them and implementing the well-designed xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::index.adoc[Lisk SDK Framework], it’s easy to compose new case-specific applications.

For more information on blockchain use cases, visit Blockchain Business in the https://lisk.io/academy/blockchain-business/blockchain-in-business[Lisk Academy].

== What is the Lisk SDK?

The xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::index.adoc[Lisk SDK] provides a development framework that enables developers to create their own custom blockchain applications with ease.

=== The Lisk SDK consists of the following packages:

* xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-framework/index.adoc[Lisk Framework]: Consists of a selection of various Modules and Components which each provide specific functionality or logic for use in blockchain networks.
* xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-elements/index.adoc[Lisk Elements]: Collection of NPM packages that provide blockchain- and lisk-specific functionalities.
* xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-commander/index.adoc[Lisk Commander]: Command line tool to interact with the network and maintain a node.

== Build a blockchain application in 3 steps

=== 1. Set up the SDK

To get started building a blockchain application, xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::index.adoc#_usage[set up the Lisk SDK].

The xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-framework/index.adoc#_modules[Modules] and xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-framework/index.adoc#_components[Components] of xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-framework/index.adoc[Lisk Framework] come with a set of predefined default configurations, allowing you to start and test your network immediately.

To get your blockchain application started for the first time, follow the steps described in the xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::index.adoc#_usage[Lisk SDK - Usage] section.

=== 2. Configure and customize the application

==== A. Configure modules and components

After the first successful start, feel free to xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::configuration.adoc[configure] the xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-framework/index.adoc#_modules[Modules] and xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-framework/index.adoc#_components[Components] to suit your specific needs.

It is also possible to exchange Modules with different ones, or to add new Modules to provide additional functionality.

To view the list of currently available ready-to-use Modules and Components, check out the xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-framework/index.adoc#_list_of_core_modules[list of Modules] and the xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-framework/index.adoc#_components[list of Components].

For a full list of all config options and their default values, see the xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::configuration.adoc#_list_of_configuration_options[List of configuration options] or the file https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/blob/development/sdk/src/samples/config_devnet.json[config_devnet.json] on GitHub.

==== B. Register custom transaction types

Transactions are the main way to add data to your blockchain.
The most basic transaction type, which is part of most blockchains, is for example a transfer-transaction type to send tokens from one account to another.
You can choose the appropriate transaction types for your application and its use case.

For comparison, please view the xref:1.1@lisk-protocol::transactions.adoc[list of all transaction types] which are implemented in the Lisk Protocol.

To create custom transaction types, utilize the provided `BaseTransaction` interface as described in the section for xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::customize.adoc[custom transactions].

See the xref:tutorials.adoc[tutorials] to see examples of how to create custom transaction types and how to add them to your application:

* xref:tutorials/hello-world.adoc[Hello World App]: A example of a Lisk blockchain application with 1 custom transaction type, which extends the BaseTransaction type.
* xref:tutorials/cashback.adoc[Cashback App]: A more practical example creating the new transaction type `Cashback`. Cashback extends the pre-existing transaction type TransferTransaction, making for a straightforward implementation.

=== 3. Interact with the network

While your network is up and running, interact with the network and the node through the API and use xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-commander/index.adoc[Lisk Commander] or xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-elements/index.adoc[Lisk Elements] to create sendable transaction objects.

To monitor and explore the network, you may want to set up a monitoring solution like e.g. https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-explorer[Lisk Explorer].

Depending on the level of customization, Lisk Explorer and Lisk Commander may also require customization to prevent other services from failing.

Another simple way to interact with the network is by connecting it to https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-hub[Lisk Hub].
Lisk Hub provides a simple and beautiful user interface to create and manage accounts on the network, and also to interact with the network by sending different types of transactions.

Once your blockchain is finished, and it is possible to send the transactions (and custom transactions), you can create a frontend to allow users to interact and use your blockchain application.
To connect your frontend to your network, we recommend to make use of xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-elements/packages.adoc[Lisk Elements’ packages] like xref:2.3.2@lisk-sdk::lisk-elements/packages/api-client.adoc[lisk-api-client].

TIP: Check out the example applications at the xref:tutorials.adoc[tutorials], to see concrete examples how to make first interactions with a blockchain application.

See more options in the xref:interact-with-network.adoc[Interact with the network] getting started section.
