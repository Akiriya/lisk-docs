== Lisk Core Docker Administration

This section details how to work with a Docker-based Lisk Core
installation. Listed below are available basic commands which can be
used to manage your Docker-based Lisk node. For more details, see each
commands reference below. A summary of all commands and associated flags
has been provided for advanced users.

=== Basic Commands

____
Below commands must be executed inside the `+docker+` directory of your
Lisk Core installation.
____

==== Status

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose ps
----

==== Start

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose start lisk
----

==== Stop

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose stop lisk
----

==== Restart

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose restart lisk
----

==== Reset / Coldstart

[source,bash]
----
make coldstart
----

==== Logs

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose logs
----

=== Configuration

Lisk Core normally gets configured by providing a suited
link:../configuration.md[configuration file]. But this isnâ€™t convenient
in a Docker installation. Instead, one can use environment variables to
change values in the configuration. To do so, open the `+.env+` file,
that you created during link:../setup/docker.md#installation[docker
installation], and adjust the values to your needs. All names of the
environment variables start with `+ENV_+` prefix.

=== Advanced configuration

For advanced configuration, open `+docker/docker-compose.override.yml+`.
Configuration variables always start with `+LISK_+` and are mapped to
their path in `+config.json+`. These can be changed directly in the file
if needed. For example, the value of `+redis.db.host+` can be changed by
setting the `+LISK_REDIS_DB_HOST+` environment variable. If you are
unsure what variable name to use, refer to the
link:source.md#command-line-options[list of command line options].

After editing the variables, reinitialize Lisk Core. It will read
`+docker-compose.yml+` and your customized
`+docker-compose.override.yml+` file:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

==== Examples

===== Use redis for caching

Caching using Redis can be enabled with the `+docker-compose.redis.yml+`
file, e.g.:

____
When specifying additional `+docker-compose+` files like
`+docker-compose.redis.yml+`, they need to be chained in the correct
order by using the `+-f+` flag like below:
____

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml -f docker-compose.redis.yml up -d
----

Note that the variables inside `+docker-compose.redis.yml+` can be
defined in `+docker-compose.override.yml+` as well.

===== Do not expose ports:

(see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#ports)

....
version: "3"
services:

  lisk:
    ports:
      - ${ENV_LISK_HTTP_PORT}
      - ${ENV_LISK_WS_PORT}
....

===== Increase log level to debug, enable public API:

(see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#environment)

....
version: "3"
services:

  lisk:
    environment:
      - LISK_CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=debug
      - LISK_API_PUBLIC=true
....

===== Add forging delegates and whitelist IPs:

(see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#environment)

....
version: "3"
services:

  lisk:
    environment:
      - LISK_FORGING_DELEGATES=publicKey1|encryptedPassphrase1,publicKey2|encryptedPassphrase2
      - LISK_API_WHITELIST=127.0.0.1,172.17.0.1
      - LISK_FORGING_WHITELIST=127.0.0.1,172.17.0.1
....

=== Sync from a snapshot

Syncing from the Genesis block can take a lot of time as the whole
blockchain needs to be downloaded and validated. To accelerate this
process, it is recommended to sync your node from a snapshot. Snapshots
are database dumps of the Blockchain on a certain blockheight. While
syncing from a snapshot, your node will only validate blocks with higher
blockheight than the one of the used snapshot.

____
Lisk provides https://downloads.lisk.io/lisk/[official snapshots] that
will be used during the automated synching process. If you want to use
third-party snapshots make sure they come from a reliable source.
____

==== Automated

[source,bash]
----
cd lisk/docker  # navigate into docker directory
make coldstart  # will download and restore a blockchain snapshot for you
----

==== Manually

The command block in the example below will perform the process. The URL
can be substituted for another `+blockchain.db.gz+` snapshot file if
desired.

===== Example

For this example we expect the environment variables equal the following
values:

* `+ENV_LISK_NETWORK=mainnet+`
* `+ENV_LISK_DB_DATABASE=lisk+`

[source,bash]
----
cd lisk/docker            # navigate into docker directory
curl --output main_blockchain.db.gz https://downloads.lisk.io/lisk/main/blockchain.db.gz  # download and save the blockchain snapshot
docker-compose up -d      # initialize Lisk and postgreSQL
docker-compose stop lisk  # stop Lisk Core
docker-compose start db   # start postgreSQL
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.make.yml run --rm db-task dropdb --if-exists lisk # drop old database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.make.yml run --rm db-task createdb lisk           # create fresh database
gzip --decompress --to-stdout main_blockchain.db.gz | docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.make.yml run --rm db-task psql >/dev/null # import snapshot into database
docker-compose start lisk # start Lisk container
