note,title="Info Note"] |Lisk Core 1.1 has been released to Testnet. If
you wish to connect to Testnet, please refer to
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-docs/blob/core-1.1.0/introduction.md[Lisk
Core 1.1.0 documentation].

This section details how to install Lisk Core from Source. When
completed, you will have a functioning node on the Lisk Network. If you
are looking to upgrade your current Lisk Core installation, please see
link:/lisk-core/upgrade/source/upgrade-source.md[Upgrade from Source].

=== Installing Lisk from Source

Before proceeding, determine whether you wish to connect your node to
the Mainnet (Main Network) or Testnet (Test Network). Clone the Lisk
Core repository using Git and initialize the modules.

==== Mainnet

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk.git
cd lisk
git checkout master
npm install
----

==== Testnet

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk.git
cd lisk
git checkout testnet-master
npm install
----

To test that Lisk Core is built and configured correctly, issue the
following command:

[source,shell]
----
node app.js
----

If the process is running correctly, no errors are thrown in the logs.
By default, errors will be logged in `+logs/lisk.log+` only. You can
change the logging level in `+config.json+`. Once the process is
verified as running correctly, `+CTRL+C+` and start the process with
`+pm2+`. This will fork the process into the background and
automatically recover the process if it fails.

[source,shell]
----
pm2 start --name lisk app.js
----

For details on how to manage or stop your Lisk node, please have a look
in
link:../../../user-guide/administration/source/admin-source.md[Administration
from Source].

If you are not running Lisk locally, you will need to follow the
link:../../../user-guide/configuration/configuration.md#api-access-control[Configuration
- API] document to enable access.

With all of the above steps complete you are ready to move on to the
configuration documentation if you wish to enable forging or SSL. Please
see link:../../../user-guide/configuration/configuration.md[General
Configuration] for more information.

=== Post-installation (optional)

==== Logrotate Setup

It is recommended to setup a log rotation for the logfile of Lisk Core.

===== Ubuntu

Ubuntu systems provide a service called `+logrotate+` for this purpose.
Please ensure Logrotate is installed on your system:

[source,shell]
----
logrotate --version
----

Next, go to the logrotate config directory and create a new logrotate
file for Lisk Core:

[source,shell]
----
cd /etc/logrotate.d
vim lisk
----

Inside this file, define the parameters for the log rotation.

Example values:

[source,shell]
----
/path/to/lisk/logs/*.log { 
        daily                   # daily rotation
        rotate 5                # keep the 5 most recent logs
        maxage 14               # remove logs that are older than 14 days
        compress                # compress old log files
        delaycompress           # compress the data, after it has been moved
        missingok               # if no logfile is present, ignore
        notifempty              # do not rotate empty log files
}
----

After customizing the config to fit your needs and saving it, you can
test it by doing a dry run:

[source,shell]
----
sudo logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf --debug
----
