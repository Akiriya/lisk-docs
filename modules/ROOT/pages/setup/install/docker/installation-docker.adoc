== Lisk Core Docker Installation

=== Get configuration & Makefile

Clone the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk[Lisk Repository]. It contains a
directory `+docker+` with the following files: - `+Makefile+` -
`+docker-compose.yml+` - `+.env.{network}+`

The `+.env+`-files are examples, where `+{network}+` stands for the lisk
network you want to connect.

[source,bash]
----
su - lisk # switch to lisk user
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk.git # clone the repository
cd lisk/docker # navigate into docker directory
----

=== Set environment variables

In order to connect to the lisk network, the environment variables need
to be set accordingly. Copy the environment variables of the network you
want to connect to:

[source,bash]
----
cp .env.{network} .env
----

=== Coldstart Application

[source,bash]
----
make coldstart
----

You can then use `+docker-compose+` to see the status of your Lisk
installation:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose ps
----
