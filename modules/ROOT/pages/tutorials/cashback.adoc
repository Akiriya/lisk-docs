== Cashback App

A simple application which rewards its users for sending tokens. The
cashback reward tokens are minted newly and increase the absolute amount
of tokens in the network.

The Cashback App implementation goes as following:

* *Steps 1-5* describe the node-side implementation of the blockchain
application.
* *Step 6* shows how to interact with the network from the (blockchain)
client-side using a node script.
* *Step 7* explains how to override specific config values.

____
Check out the *full code example* of the
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/tree/development/cashback[Cashback
App on Github].
____

=== 1. Set up Lisk SDK

First, let’s create the root folder for the Cashback App and initialize
the project:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir cashback # create the root folder for the blockchain application
cd cashback # navigate into the root folder
npm init --yes # initialize the manifest file of the project
----

As next step, we want to install the `+lisk-sdk+` package and add it to
our projects’ dependencies.

==== Supported Platforms

* Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS) x86_64
* Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) x86_64
* MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
* MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)

==== Dependencies

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|Node.js |10.15.3
|PostgreSQL |10+
|Redis (optional) |5+
|Python |2
|===

____
If you miss some of the dependencies, please go to
link:../../lisk-sdk/setup.md#pre-installation[Lisk SDK - Pre-Install]
and follow the pre-installation steps for the SDK.
____

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save lisk-sdk # install lisk-sdk as dependency for the node server side
npm install --save @liskhq/lisk-validator @liskhq/lisk-cryptography @liskhq/lisk-transactions @liskhq/lisk-constants # install lisk-elements dependencies for the client side scripts
----

____
If you haven’t already, you need to create a database before you start.
The default database name is lisk_dev, so for the development purposes,
a command createdb lisk_dev will set you up. The default database user
and password are lisk and password, they can be both changed in the
configuration of Lisk SDK.
____

Make sure to start with a fresh database.

For the *system-wide Postgres* installation:

[source,bash]
----
psql -c "DROP DATABASE lisk_dev"
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE lisk_dev OWNER lisk"
----

If you have installed
link:../../lisk-sdk/setup.md#option-a-postgres-with-docker[Postgres with
Docker], you need to run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -ti lisk_sdk_db psql -h localhost -U lisk -d postgres -c "DROP DATABASE lisk_dev"
docker exec -ti lisk_sdk_db psql -h localhost -U lisk -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE lisk_dev OWNER lisk"
----

Create the file `+index.js+`, which will hold the logic to initialize
and start the blockchain application.

[source,bash]
----
touch index.js # create the index file
----

=== 2. Configure the application

Next, let’s configure the application, to provide basic information
about the application we are going to build.

To do this, open the file `+index.js+` that was created with the command
above, and insert the following code:

[source,js]
----
//index.js
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk'); // require application class, the default genesis block and the default config for the application

configDevnet.app.label = 'cashback-blockchain-app';
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = '<username>'; // In case you gave a different user than 'lisk' access to the database lisk_dev, you need to update the username in the config
configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password'; // replace password with the password for your database user

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); // create the application instance

// the code block below starts the application and doesn't need to be changed
app
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });        
----

____
_See the complete file on Github:
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/tree/development/cashback/index.js[cashback/index.js]._
____

On `+line 2+` we require the needed dependencies from the `+lisk-sdk+`
package. The most important one is the `+Application+` class, which is
used in `+line 8+` to create the application instance. The application
instance is used to start the blockchain application at the bottom of
`+index.js+`.

On `+line 8+` the application instance gets initialized. By passing the
parameters for the
link:../../lisk-sdk/configuration.md#the-genesis-block[genesis block]
and the
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk/blob/development/sdk/src/samples/config_devnet.json[configuration
template], the application is configured with the most basic
configurations to start the node.

____
If you want to change any of the values for `+configDevnet+`, check out
the
link:../../lisk-sdk/configuration.md#list-of-configuration-options[full
list of configurations] for Lisk SDK and overwrite them like described
in link:#7-customize-the-default-configuration[step 7]
____

After adding the code block above, you can save and close `+index.js+`.
At this point, you already can start the node and the network, to verify
that the setup was successful:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

`+node index.js+` will start the node, and `+| npx bunyan -o short+`
will pretty-print the logs in the console.

If everything is ok, the following logs will be displayed:

....

=== 3. Create a new transaction type

Now, we want to create a new link:../../lisk-sdk/customize.md[custom
transaction type] `+CashbackTransaction+`: It extends the pre-existing
transaction type `+TransferTransaction+`. The difference between the
regular `+TransferTransaction+` and the `+CashbackTransaction+`, is that
Cashback transaction type also pays out a 10% bonus reward to its
sender.

So e.g. if Alice sends 100 token to Bob as a Cashback transaction, Bob
would receive the 100 token and Alice would receive additional 10 tokens
as a cashback.

image:../../assets/cashback_diagram.png[Business logic of a cashback
transaction]

____
If you compare the methods below with the methods we implemented in the
`+HelloTransaction+`, you will notice, that we implement fewer methods
for the `+CashbackTransaction+`. This is because we extend the
`+CashbackTransaction+` from an already existing transaction type
`+TransferTransaction+`. As a result, all required methods are
implemented already inside the `+TransferTransaction+` class, and we
only need to overwrite/extend explicitely the methods we want to
customize.
____

Now, let’s create a new file `+cashback_transaction.js+` which is
defines the new transaction type `+CashbackTransaction+`:

[source,bash]
----
touch cashback_transaction.js
----

To do this, open the file `+cashback_transaction.js+` that was created
with the command above, and insert the following code:

[source,js]
----
//cashback_transaction.js
const {
    transactions: { TransferTransaction },
    BigNum,
} = require('lisk-sdk');

class CashbackTransaction extends TransferTransaction {
    
    /**
    * Set the Cashback transaction TYPE to `11`.
    * The first 10 types, from `0-9` is reserved for the default Lisk Network functions.
    * Type `10` was used previously for the `HelloTransaction`, so we set it to `11`, but any other integer value (that is not already used by another transaction type) is a valid value.
    */
    static get TYPE () {
        return 11;
    }
    
    /**
    * Set the `CashbackTransaction` transaction FEE to 0.1 LSK.
    * Every time a user posts a transaction to the network, the transaction fee is paid to the delegate who includes the transaction into a block that the delegate forges.
    */
    static get FEE () {
        return `${10 ** 7}`;
    };
    
    /**
    * The CashbackTransaction adds an inflationary 10% to senders account.
    * Invoked as part of the apply() step of the BaseTransaction and block processing.  
    */
    applyAsset(store) {
        super.applyAsset(store);
        
        const sender = store.account.get(this.senderId);
        const updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus = new BigNum(sender.balance).add(
            new BigNum(this.amount).div(10)
        );
        const updatedSender = {
            ...sender,
            balance: updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus.toString(),
        };
        store.account.set(sender.address, updatedSender);
        
        return [];
    }
    
    /**
    * Inverse of applyAsset().
    * Undoes the changes made in `applyAsset` step: It sends the transaction amount back to the sender and substracts 10% of the transaction amount from the senders account balance.
    */
    undoAsset(store) {
        super.undoAsset(store);
        
        const sender = store.account.get(this.senderId);
        const updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus = new BigNum(sender.balance).sub(
            new BigNum(this.amount).div(10)
        );
        const updatedSender = {
            ...sender,
            balance: updatedSenderBalanceAfterBonus.toString(),
        };
        store.account.set(sender.address, updatedSender);
        
        return [];
    }
}

module.exports = CashbackTransaction;
----

____
_See the file on Github:
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/cashback/cashback_transaction.js[cashback/cashback_transaction.js]_
____

After adding the code block above, save and close
`+cashback_transaction.js+`.

=== 4. Register the new transaction type

Right now, your project should have the following file structure:

....
cashback
├── cashback_transaction.js
├── index.js
├── node_modules
└──package.json
....

Add the new transaction type to your application, by registering it to
the application instance inside of `+index.js+`.

____
You only need to add 2 new lines (line 3 and 11) to your existing
`+index.js+`, to register the new transaction type.
____

[source,js]
----
//index.js
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); // require application class, the default genesis block and the default config for the application
const CashbackTransaction = require('./cashback_transaction'); // require the newly created transaction type 'CashbackTransaction'

configDevnet.app.label = 'cashback-blockchain-app'; // change the label of the app
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = '<username>'; // If you gave a different user than 'lisk' access to the database lisk_dev, you need to update the username in the config
configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password'; // replace password with the password for your database user

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); // create the application instance

app.registerTransaction(CashbackTransaction); // register the 'CashbackTransaction' 

// the code block below starts the application and doesn't need to be changed
app
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----

____
_See the file on Github:
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/tree/development/cashback/index.js[cashback/index.js]._
____

After adding the 2 new lines to your `+index.js+` file, save and close
it.

=== 5. Start the network

Now, let’s start our customized blockchain network for the first time.

The parameter `+configDevnet+`, which we pass to our `+Application+`
instance in step 3, is preconfigured to start the node with a set of
dummy delegates, that have enabled forging by default. These dummy
delegates stabilize the new network and make it possible to test out the
basic functionality of the network with only one node immediately.

This creates a simple Devnet, which is beneficial during development of
the blockchain application. The dummy delegates can be replaced by real
delegates later on.

To start the network, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short
----

Check the logs to verify the network has started successfully.

If an error occurs the process should stop, and the error with debug
information will be displayed.

=== 6. Interact with the network

Now that your network is running, let’s try to send a
`+CashbackTransaction+` to our node to see if it gets accepted.

____
As your blockchain process is running in your current console window,
you need to open a new window to proceed with the tutorial. Make sure to
navigate into the root folder of your blockchain application in the new
console window.
____

In the new terminal window, create the transaction object.

[source,bash]
----
cd hello-world # make sure to be in the root folder of the Cashback application.
mkdir client # create the folder for the client-side scripts inside the cashback folder
cd client # navigate into the client folder
touch print_sendable_cashback.js # create the file that will hold the code to create the transaction object
----

Open the file `+print_sendable_cashback.js+` that was created with the
command above, and insert the following code:

[source,js]
----
//client/print_sendable_cashback.js
const CashbackTransaction = require('../cashback_transaction');
const transactions = require('@liskhq/lisk-transactions');
const { EPOCH_TIME } = require('@liskhq/lisk-constants');

const getTimestamp = () => {
    // check config file or curl localhost:4000/api/node/constants to verify your epoc time
    const millisSinceEpoc = Date.now() - Date.parse(EPOCH_TIME);
    const inSeconds = ((millisSinceEpoc) / 1000).toFixed(0);
    return  parseInt(inSeconds);
};

const tx = new CashbackTransaction({
    amount: `${transactions.utils.convertLSKToBeddows('2')}`,
    fee: `${transactions.utils.convertLSKToBeddows('0.1')}`,
    recipientId: '10881167371402274308L', //delegate genesis_100
    timestamp: getTimestamp(),
});

tx.sign('wagon stock borrow episode laundry kitten salute link globe zero feed marble');

console.log(tx.stringify());
process.exit(0);
----

____
_See the complete file on Github:
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-sdk-examples/blob/development/cashback/client/print_sendable_cashback.js[cashback/client/print_sendable_cashback.js]._
____

This script will print the transaction in the console, when executed
(Python’s json.tool is used to prettify the output):

[source,bash]
----
node print_sendable_cashback.js | python -m json.tool
----

The generated transaction object should look like this:

[source,json]
----
{  
   "id":"5372254888441494149",
   "amount":"200000000",
   "type":11,
   "timestamp":3,
   "senderPublicKey":"c094ebee7ec0c50ebee32918655e089f6e1a604b83bcaa760293c61e0f18ab6f",
   "senderId":"16313739661670634666L",
   "recipientId":"10881167371402274308L",
   "fee":"10000000",
   "signature":"0a3f41cc529f9de523cadc7db64e9436014d1b10ca2158bbce0469e8e76dfd021358496440da43acaf64d0223d3514609fc1aa41646be56353207d88a03b1305",
   "signatures":[],
   "asset":{}
}
----

Now that we have a sendable transaction object, let’s send it to our
node and see how it gets processed by analyzing the logs.

For this, we utilize the HTTP API of the node and post the created
transaction object to the transaction endpoint of the API.

Before posting the transaction, let’s check the balances of sender and
recipient, to verify later that the transaction was applied correctly:

____
Make sure your node is running, before sending API requests to it.
____

To check the account balance of the sender:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/accounts?address=16313739661670634666L" -H "accept: application/json" | python -m json.tool
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "meta": {
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 10
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "address": "16313739661670634666L",
      "publicKey": "c094ebee7ec0c50ebee32918655e089f6e1a604b83bcaa760293c61e0f18ab6f",
      "balance": "10000000000000000",
      "secondPublicKey": ""
    }
  ],
  "links": {}
}
----

Checking the account balance of the recipient:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/accounts?address=10881167371402274308L" -H "accept: application/json" | python -m json.tool
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "meta": {
    "offset": 0,
    "limit": 10
  },
  "data": [
    {
      "address": "10881167371402274308L",
      "publicKey": "addb0e15a44b0fdc6ff291be28d8c98f5551d0cd9218d749e30ddb87c6e31ca9",
      "balance": "0",
      "secondPublicKey": "",
      "delegate": {
        "username": "genesis_100",
        "vote": "9999999680000000",
        "rewards": "1500000000",
        "producedBlocks": 26,
        "missedBlocks": 0,
        "rank": 70,
        "productivity": 100,
        "approval": 100
      }
    }
  ],
  "links": {}
}
----

Because the API of every node is only accessible from localhost by
default, you need to execute this query on the same server that your
node is running on, unless you changed the config to
link:#7-customize-the-default-configuration[make your API accessible] to
others or to the public.

____
Make sure your node is running, before sending the transaction
____

[source,bash]
----
node print_sendable_cashback.js | tee >(curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- localhost:4000/api/transactions) # posts the tx object to the node and displays it on the console
----

If the node accepted the transaction, it should respond with:

....
{"meta":{"status":true},"data":{"message":"Transaction(s) accepted"},"links":{}}
....

To verify that the transaction was included in a block:

____
Use as `+id+` the id of your transaction object, that is posted to the
node in the previous step
____

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/transactions?id=5372254888441494149" -H "accept: application/json" | python -m json.tool

In this example, the sender was sending 2 LSK to the recipient, and paid
a transaction fee of 0.1 LSK. At the same time, the sender gets a
cashback of 10% of the transaction amount: 2 LSK * 10% = 0.2 LSK.

*As a result, the recipient should get a credit of 2 LSK, and the sender
s’ balance should be reduced by 1.9 LSK (-2 LSK, plus a credit of 0.1
LSK [= 0.2 LSK (cashback) - 0.1 LSK (tx fee)]).*

____
Note, that the balance of an account is stored in Beddows. 1 LSK =
100000000(= 10^8) Beddows.
____

Verify, that the sender account balance is reduced by 1.9 LSK:

If the balances equal the expected values, it is verified the new custom
transaction type `+CashbackTransaction+` is successfully integrated into
the application.

For further interaction with the network, it is possible to run the
process in the background by executing:

[source,bash]
----
cd cashback # navigate into the root folder of the Cashback application.
pm2 start --name cashback index.js # add the application to pm2 under the name 'cashback'
pm2 stop cashback # stop the cashback app
pm2 start cashback # start the cashback app
----

____
PM2 needs to be installed on the system in order to run these commands.
See link:../../lisk-sdk/setup.md#pre-installation[SDK Pre-Install
section].
____

=== 7. Customize the default configuration

Your project should have now the following file structure:

....
cashback
├── client
│   └── print_sendable_cashback.js
├── cashback_transaction.js
├── index.js
├── node_modules
└── package.json
....

To run the script from remote, change the configuration before creating
the `+Application+` instance, to make the API accessible:

____
For more configuration options, check out the
link:../../lisk-sdk/configuration.md#list-of-configuration-options[full
list of configurations] for Lisk SDK
____

[source,js]
----
//index.js
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); // require application class, the default genesis block and the default config for the application
const CashbackTransaction = require('./cashback_transaction'); // require the newly created transaction type 'CashbackTransaction'

configDevnet.app.label = 'cashback-blockchain-app';
//configDevnet.components.storage.user = '<username>'; // If you gave a different user than 'lisk' access to the database lisk_dev, you need to update the username in the config
configDevnet.components.storage.password = 'password'; // replace password with the password for your database user

configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.public = true; // make the API accessible from everywhere
//configDevnet.modules.http_api.access.whitelist.push('1.2.3.4'); // example how to make the API accessible for specific IP addresses: add 1.2.3.4 IP address as whitelisted

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); // create the application instance

app.registerTransaction(CashbackTransaction); // register the 'CashbackTransaction' 

// the code block below starts the application and doesn't need to be changed
app
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----

____
*Optional:* After first successful verification, you may want to reduce
the default console log level (info) and file log level (debug). You can
do so, by passing a copy of the config object `+configDevnet+` with
customized config for the logger component:
____

[source,js]
----
configDevnet.components.logger.fileLogLevel = "error"; // will only log errors and fatal errors in the log file
configDevnet.components.logger.consoleLogLevel = "none"; // no logs will be shown in console
----

As next step, you can use a wallet software like e.g. a customized
https://lisk.io/hub[Lisk Hub], so that users can utlize the new
transaction type.
