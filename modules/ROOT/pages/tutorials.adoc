Get onboarded to the Lisk SDK with step-by-step walkthroughs that
simplify the process of developing a proof of concept blockchain
application.

=== What do the tutorials cover?

* How to initially set up the Lisk SDK and get the network started.
* How to develop a new transaction type and how to register it with the
application.
* How to create a sendable transaction object of the new type, and

=== Hello World

Built using the Alpha SDK, our Hello World application explains how to
create a new transaction type from scratch.

=== Cashback

The Cashback application shows you how to create a new custom
transaction inherited from a pre-existing transaction type.

Built by extending the balance transfer transaction, in addition to the
regular transfer functionality, the cashback transaction also applies an
inflationary 10% to the senders account.

This tutorial is an example of a simple but valid use case - a cashback
transaction.
