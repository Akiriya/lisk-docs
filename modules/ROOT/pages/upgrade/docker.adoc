== Lisk Core Docker Upgrade

=== Upgrade minor versions

To upgrade a Lisk installation using Docker Compose you simply need to
export the new version number in `+ENV_LISK_VERSION+`.

Example: Upgrade from Lisk Core 1.5 to 1.6 by executing:

[source,bash]
----
export ENV_LISK_VERSION=1.6.0
docker-compose up -d
----

To upgrade the Lisk installation run `+docker-compose up -d+`.

=== Upgrade major versions

For major version upgrades, there can be additional changes in
`+docker-compose.yml+`.

In this case, Lisk Core provides an updated version of
`+docker-compose.yml+` in the https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core[Lisk
Core repository] on Github, inside the `+docker+` folder:
`+https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core/tree/<CURRENT_VERSION>/docker+`

(Where `+<CURRENT_VERSION>+` is the
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-core/tags[version tag] of the version you
want to upgrade to.)

Use this file as a new template for your `+docker-compose.yml+`.

The rest of the upgrade process is analog to the
