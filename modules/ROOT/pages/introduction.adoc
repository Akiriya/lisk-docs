== Mostly Harmless

Please read this carefully. The current version of the SDK is the alpha
release of the Lisk SDK. We have released the Lisk SDK in its current
form in order for us to improve the development experience through
community feedback and contributions.

We strongly discourage anyone from using the alpha release of the Lisk
SDK for any production-based blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain
operating on a real mainnet.

Over the course of the SDK’s alpha phase there will be significant
changes in the Lisk protocol and implementation, which will eventually
bring the accessibility and reliability to a level which is feasible for
production-based blockchain applications.

At this time we only recommend the Lisk SDK for proof-of-concept
blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a fake testnet.

Be aware that the dummy delegate accounts are insecure, as their secret
passphrases are public. In addition, the convenient creation of a new
genesis block is not supported by alpha release of the Lisk SDK.

The only application built using the Lisk SDK currently feasible for
production usage is https://github.com/liskhq/lisk-core[Lisk Core], the
client of the Lisk network itself.

Please be advised that we cannot guarantee blockchains created with the
alpha release of the Lisk SDK will remain compatible with our planned
(beta/rc) releases.

We hope you enjoy building your proof-of-concept blockchain applications
using the Lisk SDK and look forward to receiving your feedback and
contributions during the alpha phase.

== What is the Lisk SDK?

The Lisk SDK aims to provide an easy and reliable software development
kit for building blockchain applications compatible with the
xref:1.1@lisk-protocol::index.adoc[Lisk Protocol].

The architecture of the Lisk SDK has been designed so that it can be
extended to meet the requirements of a wide variety of blockchain use
cases.

The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript, which means for a
majority of developers, no significant change of tools is required to
get started.

The Lisk SDK makes every effort to allow developers to focus simply and
purely on writing the code that matters to their own blockchain
application, and nothing more.

== Package Directories

[width="100%",cols="23%,77%",options="header",]
|===
|Directory |Description
|xref:lisk-framework/introduction.adoc[Framework] |The application
framework establishes and maintains the interactions between the modules
of a Lisk blockchain application.

|xref:lisk-elements/introduction.adoc[Elements] |A collection of
libraries, each of them implementing some form of blockchain application
functionality such as cryptography, transactions, p2p, etc.

|xref:lisk-commander/introduction.adoc[Commander] |A command line tool
which allows developers to manage a Lisk node instance and interact with
a Lisk compatible network.
|===

== Usage

=== Dependencies

Before running Lisk SDK, the following dependencies need to be installed
in order to run applications created with the Lisk SDK:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Dependencies |Version
|NodeJS |10.15.3
|PostgreSQL |10+
|Redis (optional) |5+
|Python |2
|===

You can find further details on installing these dependencies in our
xref:setup.adoc[pre-installation setup guide].

Mind, that you need to create a database before. The default database
name is `+lisk_dev+`, so for the development purposes, a command
`+createdb lisk_dev+` will set you up. The default database user and
password are `+lisk+` and `+password+`, they can be both changed in the
xref:configuration.adoc[configuration] of Lisk SDK.

=== Installation

The installation of Lisk Alpha SDK is straightforward and limited to
getting a single NPM package, `+lisk-sdk+`, to your Node.js project:

[source,bash]
----
npm install lisk-sdk
----

Lisk SDK is all-in-one package that provides you with tools to create,
run and maintain blockchain applications in JavaScript.

In case you only need some specific functionality, it is possible to
install only the relevant package, e.g.:

[source,bash]
----
npm install lisk-commmander # install Lisk Commander
npm install lisk-elements # install Lisk Elements
npm install @liskhq/lisk-transactions # install Lisk Elements Transactions Package
npm install @liskhq/lisk-cryptography # install Lisk Elements Cryptography Package
----

____
Check out the link:lisk-elements/packages.md[full list of Lisk Elements’
packages]
____

=== Set up new a blockchain application

To start, create the project structure of your blockchain application.
Then install the xref:setup.adoc[Lisk SDK dependencies] and the Lisk SDK
afterwards.

[source,bash]
----
npm init
npm install --save lisk-sdk # make sure you installed the dependencies of lisk-sdk beforehand
----

To create a blockchain application, you need to provide an entry point
of your application (like `+index.js+`) and set-up your network by using
the modules of Lisk SDK.

It is quite simple to have a working blockchain application, mirroring
the configuration of the existing Lisk network. This can be done by
copying the following three lines of code to your `+index.js+`:

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); // require the lisk-sdk package

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); // create a new application with default genesis block for a local devnet

app.run() // start the application
   .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...')) // code that is executed after the successful start of the application.
   .catch(error => { // code that is executed if the application start fails.
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
});
----

Now, save and close `+index.js+` and try to start your newly created
blockchain application by running:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short # start the application
----

____
`+node index.js+` will start the node, and `+| npx bunyan -o short+`
will pretty-print the logs in the console.
____

This should start the application with the predefined default
configurations, which will connect your app to a local devnet. From this
point, you can start to xref:configuration.adoc[configure] and customize
the application further.

For more detailed explanations, check out the getting started sections
for building blockchain applications and the example applications,
which describe the process of creating a blockchain application
step-by-step.

=== Configure your blockchain parameters

You can also define your blockchain application parameters such as
`+BLOCK_TIME+`, `+EPOCH_TIME+`, `+MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_BLOCK+` and more
with an optional configurations object.

[source,js]
----
const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, {
    app: {
        label: 'my-blockchain-application',
        minVersion: '0.0.2',
        version: '2.3.4',
        protocolVersion: '4.1',
        genesisConfig: {
            EPOCH_TIME: new Date(Date.UTC(2016, 4, 24, 17, 0, 0, 0)).toISOString(),
            BLOCK_TIME: 10,
            MAX_TRANSACTIONS_PER_BLOCK: 25,
        },
        ...
});
----

See the xref:configuration.adoc[complete list of configuration options].

=== Register a custom transaction

You can xref:customize.adoc[define your own transaction types] with
Lisk-SDK. This is where the custom logic for your blockchain application
lives.

Add your custom transaction type to your blockchain application by
registering it to the application instance:

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet } = require('lisk-sdk');

const MyTransaction = require('./my_transaction');

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet);

app.registerTransaction(MyTransaction); // register the custom transaction

app
    .run()
    .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...'))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
----

For information on creating your own custom transaction, see the
xref:customize.adoc[customize] page or follow the tutorials.

=== Architecture Overview

The Lisk SDK operates on the NodeJS runtime and consists primarily of an
application framework (xref:lisk-framework/introduction.adoc[Lisk Framework]), a collection of libraries providing blockchain application
functionalities (xref:lisk-elements/introduction.adoc[Lisk Elements]), and
a powerful Command Line Interface
(xref:lisk-commander/introduction.adoc[Lisk Commander]) which allows
developers to manage a Lisk node instance and interact with a Lisk
compatible network.

The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:
