== Introduction

Lisk Core is the program that implements the
link:../lisk-protocol/introduction.md[Lisk Protocol]. Every machine must
set it up to run a node that allows for participation in the network.
Setting up Lisk Core enables a user to:

* Connect to a link:#networks[Network] and communicate with other nodes
in the network.
* Full control to link:configuration.md[configure] Lisk Core to specific
needs, as required.
* Create your own link:#snapshots[snapshots] of the blockchain.
* Use Lisk Core to perform actions on the Lisk blockchain, e.g. with
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-docs/blob/master/lisk-hub/introduction.md#network-switcher[Lisk
Hub].
* link:configuration.md#forging[Forge] new blocks (if you are an active
delegate).

By setting up your node, you contribute to the decentralization of the
Lisk network.

An instance of Lisk Core is generally detailed in two different ways:

____
A Lisk Core instance connected to a network is referred to as a Lisk
*Node*. A Lisk Node connected to other Lisk Nodes is referred to as a
Lisk *Peer*.
____

Both meanings refer to a machine which, after installing and executing
Lisk Core, become a server. The server participates in the network and
provides blockchain data to its clients.

== Versioning schemes

Lisk Core is described in 2 different versioning schemes. The *Software
Implementation Version* and the *Protocol Version*.

=== Software implementation versioning

Any Lisk Core software changes, except for the logging system, are
communicated following the exact rules specified by
https://semver.org/[SemVer].

Software implementation versioning has a version prefix `+v+` followed
by a 3 digit notation `+<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>+` , where the individual
digits represent the following types of software changes:

....
v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>

v     - Version prefix
MAJOR - Breaking change
MINOR - New feature
PATCH - Bug fix
....

The _software implementation version_ follows the popular SemVer scheme
and gives a quick overview for developers about breaking and
non-breaking changes in the software.

=== Protocol versioning

The _protocol version_ is denoted by two digits, `+H.S.+`. The first
digit, `+H+`, depends on the number of hard forks and is incremented
with every hard fork. `+S+` represents the number of soft forks since
the last hard fork.

____
The initial protocol version 1.0 is defined to be the one that was
implemented by Lisk Core v1.0.0.
____

The _protocol version_ is used e.g. in P2P Communication between Lisk
Core nodes, to determine, if the nodes have compatible versions of the
Lisk protocol implemented.

== Upgrade vs Migration

When to upgrade, when to migrate Lisk Core?

Every time that a new software update of Lisk Core introduces a *hard
fork* on the network, you need to link:migration.md[migrate] your
existing Lisk Core version.

In all other cases, you can use the normal *upgrade* process, according
to the distribution you are using: - link:upgrade/binary.md[Upgrade Lisk
Core Binary] - link:upgrade/docker.md[Upgrade Lisk Core Docker] -
link:upgrade/source.md[Upgrade Lisk Core Source]

== Networks

Lisk Core can be connected to different networks. There are two key
public networks, entirely independent of each other, that are always
accessible: *Mainnet* and *Testnet*.

=== Mainnet

Mainnet is where the true Lisk economy exists. On this network, Lisk
users can transfer LSK tokens from one account to another, register
accounts as delegates, vote for other delegates or register dApps. It
can be explored via the https://explorer.lisk.io[Lisk Explorer].

=== Testnet

Testnet is an independent replica of the Lisk Mainnet intended as an
area to rehearse upgrades before they take place on the Lisk Mainnet.
This is where new versions and fixes of Lisk Core are tested. It can be
explored via https://testnet-explorer.lisk.io[Lisk Testnet Explorer].

== Distributions

The 3 supported distributions for Lisk Core are presented below:

=== link:setup/binary.md[Binary]

The *default* way to setup Lisk Core. The binary installation is an easy
and automated way to set up Lisk Core, this includes nearly completely
automated update scripts and a selection of tools to help seamlessly
maintain a Lisk Node.

=== link:setup/docker.md[Docker]

Docker adds support for additional platforms upon which to run a Lisk
node, e.g. running a Lisk node inside of a Docker on Windows and
connecting it via a custom Node on Lisk Hub to Lisk Core, without the
need to rent an additional server.

=== link:setup/source.md[Source]

This is made for anyone wishing to develop on the Lisk Core codebase. It
also comes with an extensive test-suite, detailed in `+README.md+`.
Installation from Source enables a developer to work on the newest
codebase for Lisk Core, which might not have been tagged for a release,
yet.

== Snapshots

A snapshot is a backup of the complete blockchain. It can be used to
speed up the sync process, instead of having to validate all
transactions starting from genesis block to current block height. Lisk
provides official snapshots of the blockchain, see
http://snapshots.lisk.io.

How to rebuild from a snapshot, and how to create your own snapshots is
explained in the Administration section for each
link:#lisk-core-distributions[distribution] of Lisk Core.

____
We recommend using link:administration/binary.md#create-snapshot[Lisk
Core Binary] for creating own snapshots, as it provides a script to
create snapshots most convenience.
____

== Technology stack

The Lisk Core consists of 4 main technologies:

https://nodejs.org[image:assets/nodejs.png[Node.js,title="Node.js"]]

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] serves as the underlying engine for code
execution in Lisk Core. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform
JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code
server-side. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that
makes it lightweight and efficient.

https://swagger.io[image:assets/swagger-logo.png[Swagger,title="Swagger"]]

https://swagger.io[Swagger] is an open source software framework backed
by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build,
document, and consume RESTful Web services. As part of the Lisk Core
documentation, the whole API specification can be explored interactively
via the Swagger-UI interface.

https://www.postgresql.org[image:assets/postgresql.png[PostgreSQL,title="PostgreSQL"]]

https://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL] is a powerful, open source
object-relational database system with over 30 years of active
development which has earned it a strong reputation for reliability,
feature robustness, and performance. All Information on the Lisk
mainchain is stored inside of PostgreSQL databases.

https://redis.io[image:assets/redis.png[Redis,title="Swagger"]]

https://redis.io[Redis] is an open source, in-memory data structure
store. Lisk Core mainly uses it to cache API responses. This prevents
performance drops in the application, for example when the same API
request is sent repeatedly.
