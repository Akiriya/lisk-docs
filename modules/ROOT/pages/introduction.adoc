=== Versions

We release new versions of Lisk Core regularly. Documentation on
https://lisk.io/documentation[lisk.io] will keep up to date with version
updates. The Lisk Core version reference below provides an overview
about the former releases and documentation versions of Lisk Core.

=== Versioning schemes

Lisk Core is decribed in 2 different versioning schemes. The *Software
Implementation Version* and the *Protocol Version*.

==== Software implementation versioning

Any Lisk Core software changes, except for the logging system, are
communicated following the exact rules specified by
https://semver.org/[SemVer].

Software implementation versioning has a version prefix `+v+` followed
by a 3 digit notation `+<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>+` , where the individual
digits represent the following types of software changes:

....
v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH> 

v     - Version prefix
MAJOR - Breaking change
MINOR - New feature
PATCH - Bug fix
....

The _software implementation version_ follows the popular SemVer scheme
and gives a quick overview for developers about breaking and
non-breaking changes in the software.

==== Protocol versioning

The _protocol version_ is denoted by two digits, `+H.S.+`. The first
digit, `+H+`, depends on the number of hard forks and is incremented
with every hard fork. `+S+` represents the number of soft forks since
the last hard fork.

____
The initial protocol version 1.0 is defined to be the one that was
implemented by Lisk Core v1.0.0.
____

The _protocol version_ is used e.g.Â in P2P Communication between Lisk
Core nodes, in order to determine, if the nodes have compatible versions
of the Lisk protocol implemented.

=== What is Lisk Core?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfF9EPwQDOY[image:https://img.youtube.com/vi/RfF9EPwQDOY/0.jpg[What
is Lisk Core?]]

Lisk Core is the program that implements the
link:/lisk-protocol/introduction.md[Lisk Protocol]. Every machine must
set it up in order to run a node that allows for participation in the
network. Setting up Lisk Core enables a user to: - Contribute to the
decentralisation of the Lisk network - Explore data recorded on the Lisk
blockchain - Post transactions to the Lisk blockchain - Enable/Disable
forging for a registered delegate - Configure Lisk Core to specific
needs, as required

An instance of Lisk Core is generally detailed in two different ways:

____
A Lisk Core instance connected to a network is referred to as a Lisk
*Node*. A Lisk Node connected to other Lisk Nodes is referred to as a
Lisk *Peer*.
____

Both meanings refer to a machine which, after installing and executing
Lisk Core, become a server. The server participates in the network and
provides blockchain data to its clients.

==== Networks

Lisk Core can be connected to different networks. There are two key
public networks, entirely independent of each other, that are always
accessible: *Mainnet* and *Testnet*.

===== Mainnet

Mainnet is where the true Lisk economy exists. On this network, Lisk
users are able to transfer LSK tokens from one account to another,
register accounts as delegates, vote for another delegates or register
dApps. It can be explored via the https://explorer.lisk.io[Lisk
Explorer].

===== Testnet

Testnet is an independent replica of the Lisk Mainnet intended as an
area to rehearse upgrades before they take place on the Lisk Mainet.
This is where new versions and fixes of Lisk Core are tested. It can be
explored via https://testnet-explorer.lisk.io[Lisk Testnet Explorer].

Each connects to a network specified in the config file
https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk/blob/development/config.json#L2[`+config.json+`].
When a user decides which network they wish to connect to, they must
follow the correspondent tutorial in the link:setup/setup.md[Setup]
section.

==== Components

The Lisk Core consists of 4 main components:

https://nodejs.org[image:modules/ROOT/assets/nodejs.png[Node.js,title="Node.js"]]

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] serves as the underlying engine for code
execution in Lisk Core. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform
JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code
server-side. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that
makes it lightweight and efficient.

https://swagger.io[image:modules/ROOT/assets/swagger-logo.png[Swagger,title="Swagger"]]

https://swagger.io[Swagger] is an open source software framework backed
by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build,
document, and consume RESTful Web services. As part of the Lisk Core
documentation, the whole API specification can be explored interactively
via the Swagger-UI interface.

https://www.postgresql.org[image:modules/ROOT/assets/postgresql.png[PostgreSQL,title="PostgreSQL"]]

https://www.postgresql.org[PostgreSQL] is a powerful, open source
object-relational database system with over 30 years of active
development which has earned it a strong reputation for reliability,
feature robustness, and performance. All Information on the Lisk
mainchain is stored inside of PostgreSQL databases.

https://redis.io[image:modules/ROOT/assets/redis.png[Redis,title="Swagger"]]

https://redis.io[Redis] is an open source, in-memory data structure
store. Lisk Core mainly uses it to cache API responses. This prevents
performance drops in the application, for example when the same API
request is sent repeatedly.
