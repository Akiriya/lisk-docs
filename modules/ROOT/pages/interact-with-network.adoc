== Interact with the network

=== What does it mean to interact with the network?

Every action that puts data on the blockchain, or gets data from it, is
an interaction with the blockchain network.

=== Who or what interacts with the network?

* *1. Developers* will want to test and improve the functionality of
blockchain applications. For quick interaction we recommend to use
link:#a-use-the-command-line[Lisk Commander].
* *2. Exchanges* interact heavily with the network, e.g.Â by transferring
tokens for their customers. We highly recommend exchanges to
link:maintain-node.md[set up a node] to interact with the network
reliably.
* *3. Delegates* interact with the network by forging new blocks and
adding them to the blockchain. A delegate is also typically a *node
operator*.
* *4. Node operators* have a general interest in monitoring their node
and the network. Their node provides them with a private API that can be
used to make different queries or to post transactions to the network.
Depending on their preferences, node operators might want to use
link:#a-use-the-command-line[Lisk Commander],
link:#b-write-scripts-in-javascript[Lisk Elements] or a graphical
interface like link:#c-use-lisk-hub[Lisk Hub].
* *5. Applications* interact through the API with the network. For
convenience, applications would use wrappers like
[@liskHQ/lisk-api-client](../lisk-sdk/lisk-elements/packages/api-client.md).
* *6. LSK Token Holders* mostly interact with the network through
Graphical User Interfaces such as wallet applications like
https://lisk.io/hub[Lisk Hub] or Lisk Mobile.

=== How to interact with the network?

____
The following tools are suited for interacting with the Mainnet and
Testnet of Lisk. They can also be used to interact with other blockchain
applications that have been developed using the Lisk SDK.
____

You can choose from up to 4 ways to interact with an existing network
based on what is most convenient for your needs:

* *A. Write scripts in Javascript*
link:../lisk-sdk/lisk-elements/introduction.md[Lisk Elements] is a
collection of Javascript libraries that help applications to interact
with the network. On the
link:../lisk-sdk/lisk-elements/packages.md[Packages page] of Lisk
Elements, all available libraries are listed and documented. One of the
most useful packages in this regard is the
[@liskhq/lisk-api-client](../lisk-sdk/lisk-elements/packages/api-client.md)
as it provides a slick interface to interact with the network in
Javascript.
* *B. Use the Command-line*
link:../lisk-sdk/lisk-commander/introduction.md[Lisk Commander] is the
CLI-tool that lets you interact with the network conveniently through
the command line. See a list of all commands and their example responses
on the link:../lisk-sdk/lisk-commander/user-guide/commands.md[Commands
page].
* *C. Use Lisk Hub* https://lisk.io/hub[Lisk Hub] is the Graphical User
Interface (GUI) to interact with the network. It consists of wallet
functionalities like sending transactions and viewing account history,
as well as more extended features like delegate voting or registering as
a delegate.
* *D. Use Lisk Explorer* - https://explorer.lisk.io/[Lisk Explorer] is a
web application that offers tools to explore the network and the data in
the blockchain.
* *E. Query the API* - To query the
https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/api[API] manually, either from a
public node, or connect to your own private node to interact with the
network.

____
View the full specification of the Lisk API, including example queries
at
https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/api[lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/api]
____

To execute the query, use any tool suitable for HTTP API requests.

*Popular tools for HTTP requests:*

* https://curl.haxx.se/[Curl]: Perform API requests from the
command-line.
* https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman]: user friendly graphical
interface for sending API requests.
* https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/api[Swagger UI]: A
Webinterface that can send API requests in addition to providing the
complete API specification.

==== Use a public node

There are a number of nodes that are available for public use.

LiskHQ for example is running a public testnet node, that is also used
to make https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-core/api[live requests] while
trying out the different API endpoints in the documentation.

____
When hitting the ``Try it out'' button beside each endpoint, it is
possible to execute the corresponding API request and get a live
response from Lisk Testnet. It will also display the corresponding curl
command to make the request from the command-line.
____

==== Use your private node

When link:maintain-node.md[setting up Lisk Core], the API will be
private by default, which means API requests will be only accepted from
localhost.

To change this, it is possible to define exclusive
link:../lisk-core/configuration#api-access-control[whitelists], that
allow specific addresses to perform API requests on that node.
