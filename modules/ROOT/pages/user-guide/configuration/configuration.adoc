=== API Access Control

Controlling access to a node plays a vital role in security. The
following configurable flags are available in order to control the
access to your node:

[source,json]
----
     "api": {
        "enabled": true, // Controls the API's availability. If disabled no API access is possible
        "access": {
            "public": false, // Controls the whitelist. When true all incoming connections are allowed
            "whiteList": ["127.0.0.1"] // This parameter allows connections to the API by IP. Defaults to only allow local host
        },
----

The recommended setup is to configure a whitelist for only trusted IP
addresses, such as your home connection. Use IPV4 addresses only as the
whitelist does not support IPV6.

To setup a public wallet, simply leave the`+api.access.whitelist+` array
empty.

For best security, disable all access setting `+api.enabled+` to
`+false+`.

monitoring scripts from functioning.

=== Forging

In order to enable your node to forge, you need first to insert some
encrypted data into the config file under forging.delegates array. To
encrypt your passphrase, we offer and recommend one of the following
alternatives:

* link:/lisk-commander/user-guide/commands/commands.md[Lisk Commander]
via `+encrypt passphrase+` command
* link:/lisk-elements/user-guide/cryptography/cryptography.md[Cryptography
module from Lisk Elements]

We explain further the first alternative. First, make sure you have
installed Lisk Commander in a secure environment. Upon completion,
please follow the commands below to generate the encryptedPassphrase:

[source,shell]
----
$ lisk
lisk> encrypt passphrase --output-public-key
Please enter your secret passphrase: *****
Please re-enter your secret passphrase: *****
Please enter your password: ***
Please re-enter your password: ***
{
        "encryptedPassphrase": "iterations=1000000&cipherText=30a3c8&iv=b0d7322bf24e0dfe08462f4f&salt=aa7e26c9f4317b61b4f45b5c6909f941&tag=a2e0eadaf1f11a10b342965bc3bafc68&version=1",
        "publicKey": "a4465fd76c16fcc458448076372abf1912cc5b150663a64dffefe550f96feadd"
}
----

[arabic]
. In the first step, type in your passphrase and then type in the
password you want to use for encryption.
. Afterwards you will get an `+encryptedPassphrase+` key value pair.
. Create the JSON object and add it to your `+config.json+` under
`+forging.delegates+`:

[source,json]

Forging
     "forging": {
        "force": false,
        "delegates": [
                {
                "encryptedPassphrase":
 "salt=5426da113a5896f11255f69bb49c49eb&cipherText=947b537de9&iv=67d7344ce8a3b2fc879e316a&tag=dc5db5bfb41a3e968278e99651c68523&version=1",
                "publicKey":
                    "9d3058175acab969f41ad9b86f7a2926c74258670fe56b37c429c01fca9f2f0f"
           }              
         ],
        "access": {
            "whiteList": [
                "127.0.0.1", "REPLACE_ME" // Replace with the IP you will use to access your node
            ]
        }
    },

. Reload your Lisk Core process to make the changes in the config
effective, e.g. for Binary install, run : `+bash lisk.sh reload+`

==== Enable/Disable Forging

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Info |Note
|image:../../modules/ROOT/assets/info-icon.png[info
note,title="Info Note"] |The endpoint to perform this action is
*idempotent* what it means, the result has to be the same, no matter how
many times you execute the same command.
|===

If you are running your Lisk Node from a local machine, you can enable
forging through the API client, without further interruption.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Important |Note
|image:../../modules/ROOT/assets/important-icon.png[important
note,title="Important Note"] |Remember that after restarting you Lisk
node, you must need to re-enable forging again.
|===

Use the following curl command to *enable the forging* for your
delegate:

[source,curl]
----
curl -X PUT \
  http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/node/status/forging \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
          "publicKey": "YYYYYYYYY",
          "password": "XXX",
          "forging": true
      }'
----

Use the following curl command to *disable the forging* for your
delegate:

[source,curl]
----
curl -X PUT \
  http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/node/status/forging \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
          "publicKey": "YYYYYYYYY",
          "password": "XXX",
          "forging": false
      }'
----

* Where `+publicKey+` is the key for the delegate you want to
enable/disbale
* `+password+` is the password used to encrypt your passphrase in
`+config.json+`
* `+forging+` is the boolean value to enable or disable the forging
* HTTP Port can be different based on your configuration, so check
`+httpPort+` in your `+config.json+`

==== Check Forging

Use the following curl command to verify the forging status of your
delegate:

[source,curl]
----
curl \
  http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/node/status/forging \
  -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' 
----

The result should be something like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "meta": {},
  "data": [
    {
      "forging": true,
      "publicKey": "9bc945f92141d5e11e97274c275d127dc7656dda5c8fcbf1df7d44827a732664"
    }
  ],
  "links": {}
}
----

=== SSL

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Info |Note
|image:../../modules/ROOT/assets/info-icon.png[info
note,title="Info Note"] |To complete this step require a signed
certificate (from a CA), or a locally signed certificate using
LetsEncrypt. You will need both the private and public keys in a
location that is accessible to Lisk.
|===

Next snippet highlights the essential parameters to enable SSL security
on your node’s connections:

*SSL Configuration*

[source,json]
----
 "ssl": {
  "enabled": false,         // Change FROM false TO true
  "options": {
    "port": 443,            // Default SSL Port
    "address": "0.0.0.0",   // Change only if you wish to block web access to the node
    "key": "path_to_key",   // Replace FROM path_to_key TO actual path to key file
    "cert": "path_to_cert"  // Replace FROM path_to_cert TO actual path to certificate file
  }
}
----

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Important |Note
|image:../../modules/ROOT/assets/important-icon.png[important
note,title="Important Note"] |If SSL Port configured above
`+ssl.options.port+` is within well known ports range (below 1024), you
must alter the port specified with `+setcap+` or change it to be outside
of that range.
|===

*Setcap:* Only required to grant Lisk access to port 443

[source,shell]
----
 sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep bin/node
----

To verify all you have properly configured your node, open the web
client using `+https://MY_IP_OR_HOST+`. You should now see a secure SSL
connection.
