This section details how to work with a Binary installation of Lisk
Core. For further details, see each commands reference below.

=== Basic Commands

Listed below are the available basic commands which can be used to
manage your Lisk node.

==== Status

Check the status of the Lisk Core Node.

....
bash lisk.sh status
....

==== Start

Start Lisk Core and PostgreSQL.

....
bash lisk.sh start
....

==== Stop

Stop Lisk Core and PostgreSQL.

....
bash lisk.sh stop
....

==== Reload

Reload Lisk Core and pick up changes to config.json.

....
bash lisk.sh reload
....

==== Reset / Coldstart

Initializes the PostgreSQL database and starts Lisk Core.

....
bash lisk.sh coldstart
....

==== Logs

Monitor(tail) the log file of Lisk.

....
bash lisk.sh logs
....

==== Help

Display all available commands.

....
bash lisk.sh help
....

=== Management Tools

==== Update PATH environment variable

If you have installed Lisk Core with the Binary package and want to use
additional tools like `+pm2+` and `+psql+`, the corresponding PATH
variables need to be set by typing the following:

....
source env.sh
....

==== pm2

PM2 comes bundled with the Lisk Core Binary distribution and will be
available after link:#update-path-environment-variable[Updating the PATH
environment]. For more information, how to manage your Node with PM2, go
to the
link:../../user-guide/administration/source/admin-source.md[Source
Administration] page.

==== psql

The interactive terminal for postgreSQL comes bundled with the Lisk Core
Binary distribution and will be available after
link:#update-path-environment-variable[Updating the PATH environment].
For more information about available commands, see the official
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/app-psql.html[PostgreSQL
Documentation]

=== Advanced Commands

Listed below are the available advanced commands which can be used to
manage your Lisk node. For more detail, see each commands reference
below.

==== Create Snapshot

The snapshot script is used to take a backup of the whole blockchain. A
snapshot can be used to speed up the sync process, instead of having to
validate all transactions starting from block height 0 to current block
height. Lisk provides official snapshots of the blockchain, see
http://snapshots.lisk.io.

In case you want to create your own, just run the following script. It
will: 1. create a full database dump of the Lisk Blockchain 2. validate
the correctness of the blockchain, and 3. compress the result and save
it

bash lisk_snapshot.sh

==== Rebuild from Snapshot

To replace the blockchain with a new snapshot from the Lisk Foundation

[source,shell]
----
bash lisk.sh rebuild
----

===== Rebuild from a local snapshot

[source,shell]
----
bash lisk.sh rebuild -f blockchain.db.gz
----

===== Rebuild form a remote hosts snapshot

If the file is named `+blockchain.db.gz+`, use this command

[source,shell]
----
bash lisk.sh rebuild -u https://hostname/
----

To use a remote host snapshot with a different name issue this command
instead

[source,shell]
----
bash lisk.sh rebuild -u https://hostname/ -f filename.db.gz
----

===== Rebuild from the genesis block

[source,shell]
----
bash lisk.sh rebuild -0
----

==== Start node only

This command is used to start individual nodejs processes apart from the
database. It is designed to be used with customized config.json files in
order to manage vertically stacked Lisk processes on one node.

[source,shell]
----
bash lisk.sh start_node -c <config.json>
----

==== Stop node only

This command is used to stop individual nodejs processes apart from the
database. It is designed to be used with customized `+config.json+`
files in order to manage vertically stacked Lisk processes on one node.

[source,shell]
----
bash lisk.sh stop_node -c <config.json>
----

==== Start database

This command is used to start database instances apart from the Lisk
process. It is designed to be used with customized `+config.json+` files
to target specific instances.

[source,shell]
----
bash lisk.sh start_db -c <config.json>
----

==== Stop database only

This command is used to stop all database instances apart from the Lisk
process.

[source,shell]
----
bash lisk.sh stop_db
----
