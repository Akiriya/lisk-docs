=== Disclaimer: Mostly Harmless

Please read our disclaimer carefully. The current version of the SDK is
the alpha release of the Lisk SDK. We have released the Lisk SDK in its
current form in order for us to improve the development experience
through community feedback and contributions.

We strongly discourage anyone from using the alpha release of the Lisk
SDK for any production-based blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain
operating on a real mainnet.

Over the course of the SDK’s alpha phase there will be significant
changes in the Lisk protocol and implementation, which will eventually
bring the accessibility and reliability to a level which is feasible for
production-based blockchain applications.

At this time we only recommend the Lisk SDK for proof-of-concept
blockchain applications, i.e. a blockchain operating on a fake testnet.

Be aware that the dummy delegate accounts are insecure, as their secret
passphrases are public. In addition, the convenient creation of a new
genesis block is not supported by alpha release of the Lisk SDK.

The only application built using the Lisk SDK currently feasible for
production usage is https://github.com/liskhq/lisk-core[Lisk Core], the
client of the Lisk network itself.

Please be advised that we cannot guarantee blockchains created with the
alpha release of the Lisk SDK will remain compatible with our planned
(beta/rc) releases.

We hope you enjoy building your proof-of-concept blockchain applications
using the Lisk SDK and look forward to receiving your feedback and
contributions during the alpha phase.

=== What is the Lisk SDK?

The Lisk SDK aims to provide an easy and reliable software development
kit for building blockchain applications compatible with the
https://lisk.io/documentation/lisk-protocol[Lisk Protocol].

The architecture of the Lisk SDK has been designed so that it can be
extended to meet the requirements of a wide variety of blockchain use
cases.

The codebase is written entirely in JavaScript, which means for a
majority of developers, no significant change of tools is required to
get started.

The Lisk SDK makes every effort to allow developers to focus simply and
purely on writing the code that matters to their own blockchain
application, and nothing more.

==== Architecture Overview

The Lisk SDK operates on the NodeJS runtime and consists primarily of an
application framework (link:lisk-framework/introduction.md[Lisk
Framework]), a collection of libraries providing blockchain application
functionalities (link:lisk-elements/introduction.md[Lisk Elements]), and
a powerful Command Line Interface
(link:lisk-commander/introduction.md[Lisk Commander]) which allows
developers to manage a Lisk node instance and interact with a Lisk
compatible network.

The diagram below provides a high-level overview of the architecture:

|Redis (optional) |5+
|Python |2
|===

==== Pre-Installation

===== Create a new user

____
To install the required prerequisites, it is necessary to have a user
with sudo rights on the server. The `+lisk+` user itself *does not need*
any `+sudo+` rights to run the node.
____

To run and manage a node in the future, please create a separate
`+lisk+` user. E.g. execute:

====== Ubuntu

[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser lisk
----

===== Toolchain components

Used for compiling dependencies.

====== Ubuntu

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install -y python-minimal build-essential
----

====== MacOS

Ensure that both https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[XCode] and
https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] are installed.

===== PostgreSQL

To install Postgres follow the intructions descibed below, depending on
the operating system your machine is running on. If you run into issues
when trying to set up PostgreSQL on your machine, try to install it
inside of a docker container.

____
We recommend using Postgres with Docker for a quick and straight forward
setup of Postgres.
____

====== A. Postgres with Docker

Running Postgres inside a Docker container will setup the correct
version of Postgres and containerize it away from any existing versions
you may have locally on your machine. Choose this setup if you are not
familiar with Postgres, or if you run in to issues with a previously
installed version of Postgres. To perform the command below
successfully, install Docker like described in the
link:../lisk-core/setup/docker.md[Setup page of Lisk Core Docker
distribution].

____
If you have other versions of PostgreSQL installed on your machine, make
sure to stop them before starting the docker container.
____

[source,bash]
----
docker run --name lisk_sdk_db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=lisk -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=lisk_dev -d postgres:10
----

This will install PostgreSQL version 10 (`+postgres:10+`) in a container
with name `+lisk_core_db+` and binds the port `+5432+` of the container
with the same port of the machine. As environment variables we expose
`+POSTGRES_USER=lisk+` to create the lisk user and
`+POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password+` to set the password for the lisk user.
Finally the environment variable `+POSTGRES_DB+` creates the database
`+lisk_dev+` with the `+lisk+` user as owner.

The above should be enough to set up the database ready to use with Lisk
Core. To manage the Docker container, use the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker stop lisk_sdk_db # stop the container
docker start lisk_sdk_db # start the container
docker restart lisk_sdk_db # restart the container
docker rm lisk_sdk_db # remove the container
----

In case you want to access Postgres with `+psql+` inside the container,
run:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec --tty --interactive lisk_sdk_db psql -h localhost -U lisk -d postgres
----

====== B. Postgres system-wide

======= Ubuntu

Firstly, install postgreSQL on your machine:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get purge -y postgres* # remove all already installed postgres versions
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
sudo apt install wget ca-certificates
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-10
----

After installation, you should see the Postgres database cluster, by
running

[source,bash]
----
pg_lsclusters
----

Drop the existing database cluster, and replace it with a cluster with
the locale `+en_US.UTF-8+`:

[source,bash]
----
sudo pg_dropcluster --stop 10 main
sudo pg_createcluster --locale en_US.UTF-8 --start 10 main
----

Create a new database user called `+lisk+` and grant it rights to create
databases. Then create the database with the lisk user as owner. In the
last step, define the password for the lisk user:

[source,bash]
----
sudo -u postgres -i createuser --createdb lisk
sudo -u postgres -i createdb lisk_dev --owner lisk
sudo -u postgres psql -d lisk_dev -c "alter user lisk with password 'password';"
----

____
Change `+'password'+` to a secure password of your choice. Don’t forget
to update this password in the link:configuration.md[Lisk SDK
configuration] later on.
____

======= MacOS

Install Postgres version 10:

[source,bash]
----
brew install postgresql@10
----

Add it to the systems path:

[source,bash]
----
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@10/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/postgresql@10/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/postgresql@10/include"
----

Start Postgres, create the `+lisk+` user and the database:

[source,bash]
----
initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8 --locale=en_US.UTF-8
brew services start postgresql@10
createuser --createdb lisk
createdb lisk_dev --owner lisk
psql -d lisk_dev -c "alter user lisk with password 'password';"
----

____
Change `+'password'+` to a secure password of your choice. Don’t forget
to update this password in the link:configuration.md[Lisk SDK
configuration] later on.
____

===== Node.js

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] serves as the underlying engine for code
execution. There are several different ways and version managers to
install Node.JS on your system. We recommend one of the following two:

====== Option A: Node Version Manager

We recommend using a Node version manager such as
https://github.com/creationix/nvm[NVM]. NVM is a bash script that
enables you to manage multiple active Node.js versions.

[arabic]
. Install nvm following these
https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install--update-script[instructions]
. Install the correct version of Node.js using NVM:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install 10.15.3
----

====== Option B: Node.js package

If you do not want to use NVM or other package managers, you can install
the Node package globally on your system alternatively:

======= Ubuntu

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
----

======= MacOS

[source,bash]
----
brew install node@10.15.3
----

===== PM2 (optional)

Install https://github.com/Unitech/pm2[PM2] for managing start/stop of
the app process in the background:

[source,bash]
----
npm install pm2 -g
----

==== Installation

To install the `+alpha+` version of the NPM package
https://www.npmjs.com/package/lisk-sdk[lisk-sdk], run:

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save lisk-sdk@alpha # add --save flag to save it to package.json
----

==== Usage

The first steps to start developing your blockchain application:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir my-app # create the root folder for your blockchain application
cd my-app # navigate into the root folder
npm init # initialize your package.json
npm install --save lisk-sdk@alpha # install lisk-sdk alpha version and save it to package.json
touch index.js # create the index file to start the application
----

Inside of `+index.js+`, require the `+lisk-sdk+` package to create and
start the application.

Below is the minimal version of `+index.js+` that is needed to
successfully kick-start the blockchain application:

[source,js]
----
const { Application, genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet} = require('lisk-sdk'); // require the lisk-sdk package

const app = new Application(genesisBlockDevnet, configDevnet); // create a new application with default genesis block for a local devnet

app.run() // start the application
   .then(() => app.logger.info('App started...')) // code that is executed after the successful start of the application.
   .catch(error => { // code that is executed if the application start fails.
        console.error('Faced error in application', error);
        process.exit(1);
});
----

Now, save and close `+index.js+` and try to start your newly created
blockchain application by running:

[source,bash]
----
node index.js | npx bunyan -o short # start the application
----

____
`+node index.js+` will start the node, and `+| npx bunyan -o short+`
will pretty-print the logs in the console.
____

This should start the application with the predefined default
configurations, which will connect your app to a local devnet. From this
point, you can start to link:configuration.md[configure] and customize
the application further.

For more detailed explanations, check out the getting started sections
for link:../start/build-blockchain-app.md[building blockchain
applications] and the link:../modules/start/tutorials.md[example applications],
which describe the process of creating a blockchain application
step-by-step.
