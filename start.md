# Lisk Documentation

Welcome to the Lisk documentation!
Here you find all you need to setup, run and configure the different parts of the Lisk ecosystem.

## The Lisk ecosystem

The Lisk Ecosystem consists of a set of modular software products that provide developers with all the tools they need to develop their own custom blockchain applications.
It also consists of software that is needed to maintain and monitor the Lisk Main network.

What           | Why
-------------- | --------------------------------------------------
Lisk Framework | Modular set of building blocks with specific blockchain related functionality.
Lisk Core      | The software needed to run a Lisk node.
Lisk Elements  | JS library for interacting with the Lisk network.
Lisk Commander | CLI-tool to interact with the network.
Lisk Service   | Extended API interface for Lisk nodes and the extended network.
Lisk Hub       | UI for users to interact with the network, e.g. to manage their accounts, or to send or receive tokens.

## Getting started

We provide different getting started guides, that focus on different use-cases:
